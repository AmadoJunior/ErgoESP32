## Split Ortholinear Keyboard Prototype
### Uses low profile cherrymx switches. Mirrored switch footprint allows the same PCB to be used on both sides for fast prototyping.

## TO DO
### - Design mutiplexer daughter board
### - Add I2C communication between master and daughter board
### - Add CP2102N USB-to-UART bridge controller on master board
### - Implement battery charging circuit
### - Add lipo battery connector
